# AI-Audio-Transcriber
AI Powered Audio Transcriber is a beginner-friendly project I built using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and OpenAI’s API to process and interpret audio data. The system takes an audio file as input, transcribes it into text, and then leverages AI to read and process the transcribed content. This project not only demonstrated the practical use of AI in web applications but also helped me build a strong foundation in integrating third-party AI APIs within a Spring Boot ecosystem. Handling the full stack—connecting React’s user interface with a Spring Boot backend and deploying OpenAI’s models—allowed me to understand key concepts like REST communication, API integration, and managing asynchronous data flow between services.

The application has potential use cases across a wide range of industries:

- Media & Entertainment: Automating subtitles for videos and podcasts.

- Healthcare: Transcribing doctor-patient conversations for record-keeping.

- Education: Assisting with lecture transcriptions and accessibility.

- Legal & Compliance: Converting court proceedings or client meetings into searchable text.

- Corporate Sector: Generating notes from team meetings and discussions.


While designed as a learning project, it reflects how AI-powered transcription tools can significantly improve productivity across multiple domains. This experience served as a stepping stone for me in exploring AI integrations in real-world applications while strengthening my expertise with Spring Boot and modern web development tools.
